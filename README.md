# Marketing-A-B-testing
Hypothesis testing and evaluating the success of ads per company.

About the data:
It is in the interest of companies to provide users with content based on their interests, and thus to collect as many permanent users as possible. In order to find out what users like the most, A/B testing is usually applied. An experiment can be used to check how successful a change on the site is, in the form of color, shape, position, or it can be the placement of an advertising block. Usually, one group of respondents is assigned a modified site and the number of visits is monitored, and the other a standard site. The dataset that will be used is Kaggle's "Marketing A/B Testing".
